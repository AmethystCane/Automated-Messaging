Zootopia Opening Script!

IN BLACK --
We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A
timpani bangs an ominous beat.
FADE IN ON:
A JUNGLE - NIGHT
A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest,
frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.
YOUNG JUDY (V.O.)
Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!
Thousands of years ago, these were
the forces that ruled our world. A
world where prey were scared of
predators. And predators had an
uncontrollable biological urge to
maim and maul and...
The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows,
attacks the bunny, who screams--

CUT TO:
INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT
The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage
production.
YOUNG JUDY
Blood, blood, blood!
Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And
when those run out-- projectile ketchup.
Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS,
10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner
reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!
YOUNG JUDY (CONT’D)
And death.
The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as
BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.
YOUNG JUDY (CONT’D)
Back then, the world was divided in
two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.
