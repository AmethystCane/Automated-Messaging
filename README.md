# Automated-Messaging
**You can add anything you want to the text file. Personally I used the opening scrpit for Zootopia since it is one of my favourite movies ðŸ™Œ**

1) Download the files
2) Increase the timer depending on how quickly you can place your cursor on where it is you want to send the messages
3) Click run and place your cursor on the notepad, messager or app and... voila!
4) Natuarally, to be used responsibily ðŸ™‚
